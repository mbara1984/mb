            to decrease the driving current to reduce power consumption,
            vibration, and motor heating. Trial and error should suggest an
            appropriate setting. If higher torque is required, it is
            generally safe to overdrive motors as long as they are not
            operated continuously. Motor temperature is typically the best
            indication of the degree to which overdriving can be
            employed. If the motor gets too hot to touch (>75Â°C), you should
            reduce the running current.

        The current is related to the data by the formula:

            Current = CurrentCapacity * 10 / CommandData

        The range of accepted values is 0 (no current), 10 (max) - 127 (min). CurrentCapacity is the hardware's maximum capability of output current.

        To prevent damage, some devices limit the maximum output current to a lower value. In that case the valid range is 0, Limit - 127. Current limits are listed under the device specifications.

        Some devices limit the voltage rather than the current. In this case the same formula can be used by replacing Current and CurrentCapacity with Voltage and PowerSupplyVoltage.

        For example, Suppose you connect a stepper motor rated for 420mA per phase to a T-CD2500. Reversing the equation above and using 420mA as Current gives:

        CommandData (=x here)
            = 10 * CurrentCapacity / Current
            = 10 * 2500mA / 420mA
            = 59.5 (round to 60)

# * The settings for these commands are saved in non-volatile memory, i.e. the setting persists even if the device is powered down. To restore all settings to factory default, use command 36. 



# All T-Series devices use the same RS232 communications protocol. Your communications settings must be: 9600 baud, no hand shaking, 8 data bits, no parity, one stop bit. The yellow LED will light when there is activity on the RS232 lines. You may use this feature to determine which COM port you are connected to. We recommend using the Zaber Console that you can download from our web site. The source code is also available for you to use as an example for writing your own custom code. See the troubleshooting section later in this manual if you have trouble communicating with the device.

# Important: The first time you connect a device to your computer you must issue a renumber instruction to assign each device a unique identifier. This should be done after all the devices in the daisy-chain are powered up. In older firmware versions (prior to version 5xx) you must issue a renumber instruction after each powerup. In firmware 5xx and up, the device number is stored in non-volatile memory and will persist after powerdown, so you need only issue the renumber instruction when you add new devices to the chain, or rearrange the order of the devices, however it does no harm to issue the renumber instruction after every powerup. You must not transmit any instructions while the chain is renumbering or the renumbering routine may be corrupted. Renumbering takes less than a second, after which you may start issuing instructions over the RS232 connection.

# All instructions consist of a group of 6 bytes. They must be transmitted with less than 10 ms between each byte. If the device has received less than 6 bytes and then a period longer than 10 ms passes, it ignores the bytes already received. We recommend that your software behave similarly when receiving data from the devices, especially in a noisy environment like a pulsed laser lab.

# The following table shows the instruction format:
        
#     All devices renumber: 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0
#     All devices home: 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0
#     All devices return firmware version: 0, 51, 0, 0, 0, 0
#     Device 1 move to an absolute position (command 20) of 257 microsteps: 1, 20, 1, 1, 0, 0
#     Device 2 move to a relative position (command 21) of -1 microstep: 2, 21, 255, 255, 255, 255

# Most instructions cause the device to reply with a return code. It is also a group of 6 bytes. The first byte is the device #. Byte #2 is the instruction just completed or 255 (0xFF) if an error occurs. Bytes 3, 4, 5 and 6 are data bytes in the same format as the instruction command data.
# Data Conversion Algorithms

# If you are writing software to control Zaber products, you'll likely need to generate data bytes 3 through 6 from a single data value, or vise versa. The following pseudo-code can be used as a model.

# Converting command data into command bytes to send to Zaber products

# If Cmd_Data < 0 then Cmd_Data = 256^4 + Cmd_Data                                        'Handles negative data

# Cmd_Byte_6 = Cmd_Data / 256^3

# Cmd_Data   = Cmd_Data - 256^3 * Cmd_Byte_6

# Cmd_Byte_5 = Cmd_Data / 256^2

# Cmd_Data   = Cmd_Data - 256^2 * Cmd_Byte_5

# Cmd_Byte_4 = Cmd_Data / 256

# Cmd_Data   = Cmd_Data - 256   * Cmd_Byte_4

# Cmd_Byte 3 = Cmd_Data

# Converting reply bytes into a single reply data value

# Reply_Data = 256^3 * Rpl_Byte 6 + 256^2 * Rpl_Byte_5 + 256 * Rpl_Byte_4 + Rpl_Byte_3

# If Rpl_Byte_6 > 127 then Reply_Data = Reply_Data - 256^4                                'Handles negative data
